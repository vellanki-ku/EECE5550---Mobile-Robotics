The repository includes the following Python scripts:

* **CBGL.py**: This script contains the implementation for a single run of the core algorithm.

* **CBGL_Multiple.py**: This script extends the functionality of `CBGL.py` by allowing for multiple runs or iterations of the algorithm.

* **CBGL_visualization.py**: This script provides a visual representation of the robot's operation. It includes:
    * Pose hypothesis generation
    * Ranked poses
    * The planned path generated by the A* algorithm
    * The simulated movement of the robot towards the goal.
